C# is a statically typed programming language developed my Microsoft

data types 

	#value type 
		Boolean 
		character
		integer

1bit 	1byte	2byte	   4byte	8byte	16byte	           (* = singned and unsigned)
bool	*byte	char       *int     	*long	
		*short      float	double  decimal
		
	#reference type  
		array
		collection
		strings
		object (boxing: value type to object type and unboxing: object type to value type (both occur at runtime)
		dynamic (checking at runtime)
		user defined (class , interface , delegate)

	#pointer type
		type* identifier = &variable (assign)
		*indetifier 		     (ascess)
value type is stored in the stack and reference values are stored in the heap while there pointer stored in the stack pointing to that value in the heap

1. type conversion
	*implicit 
		example:-
		int intValue = 42;
		double doubleValue = intValue; // Implicit conversion from int to double

	*explicit 
		you have to use cast operators

operators (to operate on the data types)
	arthematic + - * / % ++ --
	logical && || !
	relational == != > < >= <=
	assignment = += -= *= /= %= <<= >>= &= ^= |= 
	miscellaneous sizeof() typeof() (&)address ?: is as
	bitwise & | ^ ~ << >>
	

constants/literals

syntax : const <data_type> <const_name> = <value>
	integer 
		decimal  : base10
		hexadecimal : base16 prefix (0x, 0X)
		sufixes : U ,L for unsigned and long
	floating point
		integer part
		decimal point			(ex:  6.345e-15)
 		fraction part
		exponent part (e , E)
	character constant
		enclosed in ''
		plain character 
		universal characters
			\u or \U for Unicode characters.
		escape sequence
			Escape sequence		Meaning
			\\			\ character
			\'			' character
			\"			" character
			\?			? character
			\a			Alert or bell
			\b			Backspace
			\f			Form feed
			\n			Newline
			\r			Carriage return
			\t			Horizontal tab
			\v			Vertical tab
			\xhh . . .		Hexadecimal number of one or more digits
		
	string
		enclosed in "" or @""
		whitespace
		it has literals similar to character constants like plain characters , escape sequence , universal charac.
		
	enumeration


programming paradigms
	procedural
	functional
	logical 
	oops


variables
methods/functions		(i can declare a thing and assign value to it and then use that value in program)
class
objects
