data types 

	#value type 
		Boolean 
		character
		integer

	#reference type 
		pointer 
		array
		strings
		object (boxing and unboxing)and dynamic

value type is stored in the stack and reference values are stored in the heap while there pointer stored in the stack pointing to that value in the heap

1. type conversion
	*implicit 
	*explicit 

operators (to operate on the data types)
	arthematic
	logical
	relational
	assignment
	miscellaneous
	bitwise 
	

literals
	integer 
	floating point
	character
	string


programming paradigms
	procedural
	functional
	logical 
	oops


variables
methods/functions		(i can declare a thing and assign value to it and then use that value in program)
class
objects
